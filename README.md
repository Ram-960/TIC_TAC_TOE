The 9 grids game
I developed a 9 grids game using c++ as my preferred lan‐
guage, where it includes a 9 empty grids initially,there will
be 2 players each having a specific symbol to play, they
play wisely/alternatively by placing their symbol at their pre‐
ferred empty grid, the one who makes a 3 points collinear
line first will win the game
